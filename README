# This is a pretty  simple node project. Aside from the project
    dependencies, which are not many, you'll need mongodb to be
    running on port 27017, its default, and you'll also need to
    run a newer version of node. If you use nvm, you can simply
    install and switch to a newer node installation.

# To install dependencies, run `npm install`
# To run the server, run `npm start`

# If your mongo installation requires a username and password, or
    is on a machine other than localhost, please update the
    connection string in server.js to your setup.

# I purposefully omitted, rather skipped, unit and integration
    tests as anything that I find will be irrelevant if you at
    98point6 find that something is broken. This is my first time
    using Hapi.js instead of express, so there may be some
    non-best-practices in my code that I'm unaware of. My
    apologies if these include pet-peeves of yours.

# My decision to use node.js for this was prompted by a few factors.
    First being that my most recent experience was in using node
    for API development so I naturally defaulted to it. Second -
    as I was thinking about how to approach this assignment and
    what the resulting code would look like - I wanted to avoid
    boilerplate code as possible so I didn't consider Java for this.

# Included below is a link to a Postman library. Instead of unit
    and integration tests I chose to use postman to test each
    endpoint in a manner that made sense given the time and
    requirements.
